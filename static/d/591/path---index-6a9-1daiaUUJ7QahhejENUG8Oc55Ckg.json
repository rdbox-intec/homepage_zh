You will be able to automatically construct a secure, highly scalable Wi-Fi network and Kubernetes cluster for container applications. For example, You will get a simpler and creative development experience than deploying with traditional roslaunch. Furthermore, it becomes easy to control a lot of groups of robots. Make Robot Engineers' Work a Lot Easier. You can control Network Robot with ease by RDBOX.","heading":"Export IT technologies to the robotics community.","description":"Robot engineers are considered the best and the brightest, and they can certainly multi-task. However, there are too many other (complicated and stressful) things that prevent them from concentrating on development. We, at INTEC, wanted to help those best and brightest engineers concentrate more on robot development and so we designed \"RDBOX,\" a partner to robot engineers in the IT field.","offerings":{"blurbs":[{"image":"/img/net.png","text":"Easily set up a dedicated local area network for robots.   Simply connect RDBOX in between the internet and your service robot. In one simple step, you can build a local area network and development environment. No knowledge of internet or networking is necessary.\n"},{"image":"/img/RDBOX_SHOW.gif","text":"Many network applications, including NTP, are offered with the product. Automate your network robot management. Take NTP as an example. Many company networks limit connections to public NTP servers, but RDBOX makes clock synchronization between all computers easy.

RDBOX makes it easy to build Kubernetes clusters that can mix CPU architectures. Robots are often equipped with ARM architecture CPUs in terms of power efficiency. RDBOX is not aware of the mixture with the common x86 architecture in cloud computing. No matter how many robots there are, you can control from one place. (Kubernetes Dashboard and command of kubectl.) Configure the Kubernetes cluster with all the computer resources on which the robot app runs. Start and monitor nodes and processes, and standard output from them can be handled centrally from the RDBOX.\n"},{"image":"/img/deploy_containers.png","text":"Container virtualization frees engineers from repeated setup of the OS and middleware. Save \"Docker container image\" with OS and middleware already set up in the registry. At the time of robot application development, by implementing only difference based on this container image, repetitive work is suppressed.\n"},{"image":"/img/about-ci.png","text":"Continuous development and management of robots through CI. RDBOX supports CI tool implementation. Less pressure on engineers in deployment to production environment. CI tools that are commonly used in the field of IT can also be applied for robot development. Automatic deployment can be scheduled at a convenient time according to the robots' status, such as during charging.\n"}]},"testimonials":[{"author":"COMING SOON","quote":"COMING SOON"}]}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ffd7dac1-156d-5b44-8cca-161327547865"}}
